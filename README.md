# What is QDECC ?
Quantum Decryption Encrpytion and Classification of Ciphers (QDECC) is an application for decryption of RSA algorithm, encrption of data and classification of Ciphers using Quantum Computing. It acts as a common platform for performing all these tasks.

This project provides:
-Way to classify Cipher
-Method to decrypt RSA 
-Methond to Encrypt data and detect possible interception
